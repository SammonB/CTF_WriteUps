The Cyber Sentinel Challenge was a CTF competition hosted by Correlation One and sponsored by the Department of Defense that took place on Saturday, June 14th.
The competition featured various challenges accross multiple fields of CyberSecurity with varying levels of complexity.
The theme of the competition was about a fictional, rogue nation-state called "North Torbid" that was orchestrating all kinds of attacks.
We, the contestants, would have to invesigate them in the challenges.

Listed in this directory are the different categories of challenges I completed, or at least came close to completing in the competition.
