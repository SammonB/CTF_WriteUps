Description: 
We've intercepted a radio broadcast being bounced off a satellite likely intended for the North Torbian cells located around the world. Do you think you can unravel what they are transmitting?

Attached was an audio file with repetitions of two tones, a high tone and a low tone.
I opened the file in audacity so I could examine it, although at this point I wasn't really sure what to do with it yet.
The tones appeared too quickly for me to write them down in real time, and I felt that slowing the audio down would take too long.
The audio waveform wasn't any help, so I ended up playing around in audacity and eventually switched to the spectrogram view, where the high and low tones were visually distinct.
Then the process was just to write down all the high tones as 1's and all the low tones as 0's and put them in a binary translator.

The binary this method produced only translated to garbled ASCII, but after flipping all of the bits, it translated into the flag
