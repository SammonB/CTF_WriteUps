Description: 
Our team suspects that a Juche Jaguar developer accidentally left something interesting behind on a public site. Youâ€™ve been tasked with examining its structure. Can you uncover what the bots were told to ignore? Start with the usual entry points a crawler might explore. One disallowed path leads to a page where someone left behind more than just code.

Then there was a link to a target site which mentioned something about a "robots.txt" file
After appending /robots.txt to the end of the link, I was brought to another page containing this text:

# Friendly Crawler Guidelines for North Torbia
User-agent: *
Disallow: /juchejaguar/   # Absolutely nothing valuable in here. Promise.

I wasn't quite sure what to do at first, but eventually just went back to the original page and appended "/juchejaguar/" after the URL which brought me to the flag!
Nice and simple.
