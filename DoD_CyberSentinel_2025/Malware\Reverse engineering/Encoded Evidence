Difficulty: Very Easy
Points: 75

Description:
We've intercepted a suspicious script file. It appears to be a placeholder for some kind of malware delivery mechanism, but the actual payload seems to be hosted somewhere else.
Analysts believe a flag is hidden by this script. Can you locate and decode it?

Very easy, but not very quick for me. I'm very susceptible to overlooking information right in front ot me.
I downloaded the script attached to the challenge, inside was a pastebin link with some garbled text. For some reason I didn't see the line above the link saying "should return b64"
So I didn't think to just run it through a base64 decoder to find the flag
