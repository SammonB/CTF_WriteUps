Description:
We believe that the North Torbians are heavily influenced by North Korean developments and wish to match them. We have suspicions that Juche Jaguar will try to build out similar spaces to ones in these pictures. Can you find the coordinates of where these pictures were taken?

The flag is any valid decimal degree coordinate notation within a 500m radius of the building. The flag is in the following format: C1{XX.XXX,XX.XXX}

For example, the White House would be at decimal degree notion of 38.897, -77.036. The flag for the White House would be: C1{38.897,-77.036}

Note that this flag is a regex match for any valid coordinate within the 500m radius.


For this one, I had to find a specific location in pyongyang, North Korea, where a gaming center had been built. Google maps was outdated, but I could still find relevant landmarks from images
found by searching about the gaming center. 
I found where it was pretty quickly, and then spent an hour getting the wrong answer because I was putting a space in the flag :)
