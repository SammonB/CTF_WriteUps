Description:
The malware sample doesnâ€™t appear to print anything useful. But our threat intel team believes it holds a hardcoded configuration string. Can you pull on some strings to retrieve it?

Note: This sample is not actual malware.


Another very quick one, the challenge description gave it all away. Just download and extract the file, then run strings on it and the flag was revealed.
