Description:
The malware sample doesnâ€™t appear to print anything useful. But our threat intel team believes it holds a hardcoded configuration string. Can you pull on some STRINGS to retrieve it?

Note: This sample is not actual malware.


Another very quick one, the challenge description gave it all away.
The emphasis on the word "strings" in the description immediately made me thing to just run the "strings" command in linux on the file.
This displayed the flag and the challenge was done.
