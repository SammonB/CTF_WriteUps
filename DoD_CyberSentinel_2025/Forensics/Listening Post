Description: We've intercepted a radio broadcast being bounced off a satellite likely intended for the North Torbian cells located around the world. Do you think you can unravel what they are transmitting?

Attached was an audio file with repetitions of two tones, a high tone and a low tone. I opened up the spectrogram in audacity so I could just read the tones instead of having to listen to them, and I decided to write down all the high tones as 1's and all the low tones as 0's and put them in a binary translator.

That spat out nothing so I tried flipping the bits and it worked, I got the flag easy peasy.
