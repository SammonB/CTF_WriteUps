Description:
Agents intercepted an audio file named message.mp3. It plays a single tone, but we have intel that a flag might be tucked away in the metadata fields of the file. Can you inspect the file and uncover the flag?

This one was, as the difficulty suggests, very easy.
All I had to do was download an mp3 and analyze the metadata with exiftool and the flag was in plain sight.
